# GifMe
A web app that extracts detected objects from photos uploaded by users and displays gifs related to each object that is detected. Users can also add tags and captions to their favorite gifs and save them or like them. In addition to being able to view all of their saved or liked gifs, they can also view a list of trending gifs or generate a random gif! 

Built with the PERN stack (Postgresql, Express, React, Node js.), the Microsoft Azure Object Recognition API, and the GIPHY API.
